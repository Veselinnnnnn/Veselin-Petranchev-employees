# Veselin-Petranchev-employees

The program shows the pair of employees who have worked together on common projects for the longest period of time.
The user picks up a file from the file system and, after selecting it, all common projects of the pair are displayed in datagrid.
 
P.S. Even late I found a way to solve the problem of date formats. I could simple use array  of regex patterns....
